# NumericalMethods
Here is an overview of the tasks that I have completed:

Root Finding: We have implemented several root finding methods such as Bisection, Secant, and Newton.

Golden Section Search: This optimization technique allows us to find the minimum or maximum value of a unimodal function in a specific interval.

The Python code used for these tasks can be found in the respective files.
